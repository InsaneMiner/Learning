<h1>About Learning</h1>

<p>Learning is a completely free and GNU licensed LMS (learning management

<p>You can create, modify and delete the source of Learning. You can even create
your own Learning-clone with customised courses, different blog entries and even
footer links and design, but before you do that, please first read <a
